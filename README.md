# PlantBox

Making a device to look after my plants autonomously has been an ambition of mine for a while. This is the latest (and greatest) attempt to build such a device. The device is basically a grow tent kitted out with LED lighting, some sensors, a camera and of course some plants.



## Aims of the project
The original project was quite ambitious so I thought I would tone it down slightly and create something more managable. The project is going to be a serious foray into the world of hobby hydroponics and a way to get some knowledge on vertical farms. Hopefully, I will also get some fruit and veg from it!



## Equipment List
1 80x80x180 Grow Tent
4 DHT22 sensors
1 '600W' LED 'full spectrum' Grow Light
2 IKEA Sockerbit Boxes with lids
1 Raspberry Pi Model 3B+
1 Picam
1 small white LED light matrix (for the flash)
...



## Immediate Todo List
* Update a table which cross references image filenames with time taken and any other useful info.

* Fix the DHT22 sensors (why do some not give readings at the moment?)
